#Alfred, open notion link!

This workflow makes it easy to convert Notion Links into Notion App Links and open them with the Notion Desktop App.

By default, when you click on a Notion Link, it will open in your default browser. This can be annoying if you prefer to use the Notion Desktop App to manage your Notion pages.

If you hold ⌘ the Notion Link will be opened directly in your Notion Desktop App. The default is, that the links gets copied to your clipboard.

You can activate the workflow in two ways. `nl https://notion.so …` or you can just paste your notion link into alfred like `https://notion.so/…`.
